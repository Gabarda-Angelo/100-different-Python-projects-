notes:

1.This code is functional, if it's not it's mean that the APIs need some renewal because of token limit
etc.. or in the future when the parameters has change or the way how we write the codes itself.

you can find the environment variables on .env file there is our secrets


I use my google account here on day 40: angelogabarda.scc@gmail.com to create new Sheety because I reached
the monthly quota of Sheety that's makes my account APIs not functionable.
rather than the google account: gelo.gabarda@gmail.com that I used on day 39
