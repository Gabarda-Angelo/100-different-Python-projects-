# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
'''Text never get printed out'''
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
'''it get the value ranging from 1 and stop when it reach 20'''
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
'''when the i holds the value 20'''
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
'''The value of i will never get the Text we want because
   we set the stop value at 20, so we should add 1 for i to
   hold the 20 also.
